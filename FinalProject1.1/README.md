Battleship Game
-

This programming replicates the Battleship board game wherein two players have a number of ships located within a 
playing surface and each takes turns guessing the coordinates of the opposing players ships - if a correct guess is made
then the ship has been hit. This process is repeated until all locations of either player's ships have been hit.

Gameplay Instructions
Ship locations are pre-populated by reading data from the included JSON files. User's ship locations are displayed on 
the left half of the game board in black. Hover the mouse over the right half of 
the game board and click the mouse to fire a shot on that location. The grid square will display an explosion graphic if 
an opponent ship is located at that grid square; if the shot is a miss the grid square will turn white. Shot locations 
are displayed in the console; a message is displayed in the console when a ship has been sunk.

Not implemented:
-
- Intelligence functionality for computer shots.
- Only supports user play against the computer. 
- Manual placement of user or computer ships.
